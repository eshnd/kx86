# kx86
a language to make x86 OS kernels but easy
# how it works
each command in kx86 corresponds to a set of assembly commands. when you compile your code, all the assembly stuff will be put together and compiled with nasm.
# why
i couldn't figure out how to make pixels using C and it was going to take so much longer to figure out so i decided that this would be a good enough excuse to make my own language
