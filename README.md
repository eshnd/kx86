# kx86
an imperative, modular language to make x86 OS kernels but easy
# how it works
each command in kx86 corresponds to a set of assembly commands. when you compile your code, all the assembly stuff will be put together and compiled with nasm. the functionality is written in x86 assembly and the parser is written in python3
